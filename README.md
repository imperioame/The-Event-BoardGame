# The-Event-BoardGame
 In a zombie apocalypse game, players survive by managing resources, building shelters, and fighting strategically. They place hexagons to create the board, roll dice for zombie spawns, and attack or defend against zombies. The game ends after 10 rounds; the last survivor or the one who survives the most zombie hordes wins.
